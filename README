* THE PURPOSE

Some time ago I wasn't with internet access at home, 
I had to go to a cybercafe everyday and noticied that 
one thing was missing, a tool that could help me download
distribution packages from Windows (yes, every cybercafe, 
just Windows...).

This scenario is not just about me, I think there is a lot of people 
that if start playing with FOSS software in Brazil, they will have problem 
to update their systems.Most still doesn't have internet access at home, they 
usually go to a cybercafe, school, university and still just find Windows 
stations.

I had to do something.

* FIRST, RETRIEVING THE LIST OF PACKAGES

First in your Linux distro, run the following commands to generate the "downloads.list".

** With CLI/CUI

./yumpkgs -d -p package1,package2,packageN

** With GUI

./yumpkgs -d -g

* DOWNLOADING

Now that you probably need to use Windows to get
access to the internet, no problem, just execute de
file named "download.bat".The "download.bat" file 
uses the "downloads.list" to download the files 
necessary to install the supplied packages.

* SOURCES AND DEPENDENCIES

- Wget: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net.
- Python: http://www.python.org.
- SQLite: http://www.sqlite.org/.

For advanced users I recomend the usage of the cygwin because it integrates everything
and makes the environment more Unix-like.

* FOR NEWS

I might not update this README everytime, for that purpose I'll use my blog at http://gtuxed.blogspot.com

Feel free to go there and make comments.

* PLANNING

For the v1.00 I'm thinking about a feature tha would make possible
build a "downloads.list" based on the packages that should be upgraded.

* AND MORE

That is my first python program, don't get crazy if you see strange things.
