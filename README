* THE PURPOSE

Some time ago I wasn't with internet access at home, 
I had to go to a cybercafe everyday and noticied that 
one thing was missing, a tool that could help me download
distribution packages from Windows (yes, every cybercafe, 
just Windows...).

This senario is not about just me, there is a lot of people that if start
playing with FOSS software in Brazil they will have problem to update their
systems, because most of them still doesn't have internet access at home.They 
usually go to a cybercafe, school, university and still just find 
Windows stations.

I had to do something.

* FIRST, RETRIEVING THE LIST OF PACKAGES

First in you in your Linux distro run:

./yumpkgs -d -p package1,package2,packageN

* DOWNLOADING

Now that you probably need to use Windows to get
access to the internet, no problem, just execute de
file named "download.bat" and everything will be fine.

* SOURCES AND DEPENDENCIES

- Wget: wget can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net.
- Python: the python language interpreter, you can find it at http://www.python.org
- SQLite: the database engine can be found at http://www.sqlite.org/

For advanced users I recomend the usage of the cygwin because it integrates everything and
makes the environment more Unix-like.

* FOR NEWS

I might not update this README everytime, for that purpose I'll use my blog at http://gtuxed.blogspot.com

Feel free to go there and make comments.

* AND MORE

That is my first python program, don't get crazy if you see strange things.
